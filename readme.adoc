== Installation

To use Puppeteer in your project, run:

NOTE: When you install Puppeteer, it downloads a recent version of Chromium (~170Mb Mac, ~282Mb Linux, ~280Mb Win) that is guaranteed to work with the API. To skip the download

First program takes a PNG of the `example.com` web page

.example.js
[source,javascript]
----
include::./example.js[Example1]
----

Which when it's run with the 

  node example.js

Puppeteer sets an initial page size to 800px x 600px, which defines the screenshot size. The page size can be customized with link:https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=master&show=api-pagesetviewportviewport[ Page.setViewport(), window='_blank']
